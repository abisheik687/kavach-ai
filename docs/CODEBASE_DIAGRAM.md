# Internal trace:
# - Wrong before: this diagram documented the retired browser extension, old API layout, and legacy orchestration stack that are no longer part of the active product path.
<<<<<<< HEAD
# - Fixed now: the diagram reflects the current web-only KAVACH-AI structure and the archived legacy boundary.

## 3. Notes

- The Chrome extension was removed from the active product path.
- Realtime/live analysis remains archived under `legacy/` and is not part of the running web application.
- The current product is intentionally centered on upload-and-analyse reliability across desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.

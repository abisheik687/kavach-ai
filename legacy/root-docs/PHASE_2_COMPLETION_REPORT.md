## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations:
1. **WebSocket URLs:** Hardcoded to `localhost:8000` (needs environment variable)
2. **Polling Interval:** Social media queue polls every 5 seconds (could be optimized with WebSocket)
3. **LocalStorage:** Settings stored locally (should sync with backend in production)
4. **File Size Limits:** Not enforced in frontend (backend validation only)

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Phase 3: Training Scripts**
   - Create `scripts/train/download_datasets.py`
   - Create `scripts/train/build_manifest.py`
   - Create `scripts/train/train_image.py`
   - Create `scripts/train/train_audio.py`
   - Create `scripts/train/export_onnx.py`
   - Create `scripts/train/benchmark.py`

2. **Phase 4: Model Enhancements**
   - Implement ensemble voting with weighted soft voting
   - Add test-time augmentation (TTA)
   - Integrate pre-trained models from Hugging Face
   - Enhance temporal consistency checks

3. **Phase 5: Testing & Documentation**
   - Create pytest tests for each module
   - Update README.md with 3-command startup
   - Add API documentation
   - Create user guide

4. **Phase 6: Production Readiness**
   - Add WebSocket reconnection logic
   - Implement file upload validation
   - Ensure responsive design across all pages
   - Performance optimization and load testing

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Needed:
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000
```

### Frontend Build:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

### Integration with Backend:
All new pages are ready to be added to the React Router configuration in `frontend/src/main.jsx`:

```javascript
import LiveDetectionPage from './pages/LiveDetectionPage';
import SocialMediaPage from './pages/SocialMediaPage';
import HistoryPage from './pages/HistoryPage';
import SettingsPage from './pages/SettingsPage';

// Add routes:
<Route path="/live-detection" element={<LiveDetectionPage />} />
<Route path="/social-media" element={<SocialMediaPage />} />
<Route path="/history" element={<HistoryPage />} />
<Route path="/settings" element={<SettingsPage />} />
```
